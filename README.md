## About Local Land Charges

Local Land Charges is made up of two services on the GOV.UK domain, maintain and search service.

### Search Service

This is a publicly accessible service used by primarily civilians and private search companies. It allows users to define an area on a map they want to search for local land charges. They can either view information for free or pay for and official search. An official search can be used as the name suggests for official purposes. Such as house buying and other legal purposes.

### Maintain Service

This service is not in the public domain and acts more as a admin interface only accessible to local authorities and other relevant agencies who need to update the local land charge register, such as Highways England.

## Access the prototype
